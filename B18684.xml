            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AN Act passed in the Years 92 and 93, Granting to His Majesty an Aid of four Shillings in the Pound upon Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by virtue of which the Parish of St. <hi>George</hi> did assess Three thousand seventy three Pounds sixteen Shillings and Six Pence: Since then the said Parish is abated in the value of the Rents almost one half; occasioned by a late Act of Parliament for regulating Abuses in Prisons and pretended priviledged Places, as may appear by the <hi>Kings-Bench Prison;</hi> being in the above Years, rated at fourteen hundred Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> which Sum the present Marshall in 1699, (by appeal upon Oath) abated to four hundred Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> the Rents of the Houses are fallen proportionably: Notwithstanding the Parish did raise, by virtue of an Act passed in 97 and 98, Granting to His Majesty an Aid of Fourteen hundred forty eight thousand and fifteen Pounds, fifteen Shillings and eleven pence three Farthings, to be raised upon Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Two thousand three hundred and four Pounds, five Shillings and eight Pence Half-penny, (which Sum is the three fourths of what was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed on the Parish in 92 and 93) to raise which the Landlords did pay Four Shillings and two pence in the Pound; and many Landlords having the Misfortune of some Houses empty, paid more to the Tax than half of what they received for Rent.</p>
            <p>And by another Act passed 98 and 99, Granting to His Majesty an Aid of fourteen hundred forty eight thousand and fifteen pounds, fifteen Shillings and eleven Pence three Farthings, to be raised upon Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and now collecting) the Proportion which the said Parish must raise is two thousand three hundred and four Pounds, five Shillings and eight Pence Half-penny; to raise which the Landlords must pay more than five Shillings in the Pound: and those that have many Houses, and some of them empty, will pay more than half their Rent, besides some of those that are inhabited; the Poverty of the Tenants is such, That the Collectors cannot find Goods sufficient to distrain for the Tax; which Truth (if needful) can be made evident by the Collectors and others.</p>

            <p>So that the Parish have, and must pay in Money the three fourths of five hundred eighty five Pounds, one Shilling and nine Pence, which could not be collected in 93.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Rules,</hi> (which is two thirds of the Parish), the Houses which in 93, lett at 28 <hi> l. per Ann.</hi> are now in 99, lett at 12 <hi> l. per Ann.</hi> others that went at lesser Rents are fallen in proportion; besides a great Number of Houses empty, as will appear by the Affidavits of the Parishoners, if they may be permitted.</p>
            <p>In the Year 93, the Rents of the Parish amounted to ten thousand Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> and now in 99 not six thousand Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> and yet pay Taxes proportionable to ten thousand Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> so that the Case of this Parish is such, as a Man having in 93 two hundred Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> and in 98, one hundred Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> is lost by virtue of an Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and yet must pay Taxes to the King as if he had the two hundred Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Estates within the <hi>Mint, Rules, &amp;c.</hi> are such as will be sold for Six and Eight Years purchase, and yet pay more than five Shillings in the Pound, when some other Estates worth two and twenty Years purchase, 'tis very probable pay not above twelve Pence in the Pound.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis therefore Humbly prayed, That this HONOƲRABLE HOƲSE, in their great Wisdom and Goodness, (the Premisses, considered) will relieve the Landlord for the future, from bearing so disproportionable a share of Taxes, as they shall see most reasonable, otherwise the Landlord must sink under so great a Burden.</hi>
